## Description 
This is a small and simple exploration of data I scraped of the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films.
It project evolved from a in-class assignment that I wanted to take further.
The goals of this project was to scrape data from a website, make visualizations in R, and practice writing skills
I started the project before I knew any advanced R coding and analysis techniques but provided me with a stage to learn R and ggplot2.

- Data Scraping
- Data Cleaning
- Data Manipulation
- Data Visualization
- Technical Writing

## Tools:
- Rmarkdown
- ggplot2
- dplyr
